        <p class="intro text-center"><strong>I’m a mother, a teacher, a long-time community organizer, and I’m fighting
            for a Philadelphia that works for all of us.</strong></p>
        <img class="pix" src="https://i.imgur.com/AjyNiTv.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-left">I cut my teeth fighting mayors and developers who would take publicly funded land for
          private boondoggles like stadiums, casinos and for-profit charter schools. Having grown up in an immigrant
          family, I
          know that public spaces are our best shot at an equal society. I depended on my public library, rec center
          and, of
          course, my public school to give me the kinds of opportunities my parents could not.</p>
        <p class="text-left">That’s why I’ve been so fired up when public spaces go into decline: When a neighborhood
          park which should provide recreation and relaxation becomes an abandoned eyesore. When a public school closes
          down.
          When our streets feel unsafe rather than vibrant. When we lose a sense of connectedness to one another.</p>
        <img class="pix" src="https://i.imgur.com/a90kec0.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-left">In the poorest large city in the U.S., we cannot afford to walk away from our collective
          responsibility to build a Philadelphia for all of us. I came to this city almost 30 years ago, raised three
          children, and started my teaching career at Lowell Elementary School in Olney. All of my work has been about
          strengthening communities and establishing a human rights agenda based on a quality public school for every
          child, housing as a human right, a justice system that serves the common good, and the belief that one job
          should be
          enough.</p>
        <p class="text-left">When I ran for City Council in 2015, I knew what we had built together was impossible to
          ignore and that a coalition which had centered the voices of our youth, of immigrants, and of poor and working
          people
          across this city would lead a vision for Philadelphia that would be bigger and more unifying and inspiring
          than anything that had come out of City Hall before.</p>
          <img class="pix" src="https://i.imgur.com/nRFqyDi.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-left">We won.</p>
        <p class="text-left">Since the day I was sworn in, I’ve gotten to work to show this city what it looks like to
          put people before profits and how to fight like hell for our children, our communities and our future. We’ve
          reversed a devastating narrative on public schools and our youth, rejecting the profiteers and privatizers who
          had tried
          to shut down the most important path to a vibrant and healthy economy – a quality public school for every
          child.
          Not only did I champion the end of the 17-year state takeover of our public schools, I’m leading the most
          aggressive and ambitious schools agenda to come out of City Hall in decades – one that has restored nurses,
          counselors and
          music programs to every school, doubled the number of social workers to help students and families, reduced
          the
          school-to-prison pipeline by ending suspensions in lower grades, and improved school facilities by
          guaranteeing clean modern water fountains and lead abatement projects for every elementary school.</p>
        <p class="text-left">Many people talk about an anti-poverty agenda; I’m leading one. I introduced and passed the
          most
          expansive “Fair Workweek” law in the nation, ensuring protections for part-time workers in our city taking
          home the
          lowest wages working for the wealthiest corporations. Next year, more than 100,000 Philadelphians will be on a
          path
          to two weeks advance notice of their schedules, protection from retaliation, and a chance to qualify for
          full-time
          hours. I’m fighting for housing as a human right, establishing the first legal defense fund for tenants facing
          eviction and winning a citywide initiative to end the eviction crisis. And I’m taking on the city’s biggest
          tax
          subsidy which fuels inequity and inequality across our city, the 10-year tax abatement, and making it work for
          our
          communities and our school system.</p>

        <p class="text-left">I’m taking a regional approach to Philadelphia. It’s not just about our boundaries but
          about
          expanding our influence as the economic driver for southeastern Pennsylvania and the tri-state region. That’s
          why
          I’m focused on education, transit and the environment as core areas where we can improve the political and
          collaborative relationships to drive mobility, jobs and a growing and interrelated economy.</p>
        <img class="pix" src="https://i.imgur.com/i51CJGt.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-left">And yes, you’ll see me at the airport protesting Trump’s Muslim Ban, railing at the Parking
          Authority to fund our schools, and shutting down facilities like Wordsworth and Glen Mills when they abuse
          vulnerable youth. You’ll also see me celebrating the best of Philadelphia by using our voices to bring joy and
          honor
          to our city, whether we’re honoring Philadelphia’s civil rights heroes or claiming an insurrectionary NHL
          mascot as
          the non-binary leftist icon this world needs.</p>

        <p class="text-left">I’ve always believed that cities would define the progress of this nation. Because no
          matter
          what’s happening in D.C. or Harrisburg, this is still our Philadelphia.</p>

        <p class="text-left">I’m running for re-election because we have so much more to win. From debt-free college to
          fair
          taxation, from focusing on safe and clean communities to leading on a municipal Green New Deal, Philadelphia
          needs a
          champion who’s fighting for parents, working families, and Philadelphians everywhere.</p>

        <p class="text-left">Let’s make this happen together.</p>
